# Downgrading Roblox
At first, it may seem *simple*, as all you need to do is download another version of the Roblox player.

But, it is actually kinda simple, if you get the right version.

## Tutorial
1. Go to https://rdd.latte.to
2. Put in the channel LIVE and the version hash. (e.g. https://rdd.latte.to/?channel=LIVE&binaryType=WindowsPlayer&version=version-347f4ac346734391)
3. Download it, extract it and launch the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe to get runnin' ðŸš€
